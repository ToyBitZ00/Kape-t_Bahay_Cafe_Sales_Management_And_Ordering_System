Use Camel Case for naming conventions of variables and functions, so that it is easier to read. 

Example: firstLetterIsAlwaysCapitalCaseExceptForTheFirstWord

NOTICE: Whenever you create a new window, make sure its placed inside a "def" function and name them properly to avoid confusion.
USE "create_[window name]_window()" format when naming the function.
